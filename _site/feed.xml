&lt;p&gt;Do you notice a small pool of water where your toilet meets the floor? Does the floor around the toilet feel spongy? Is the finished flooring coming up? If so, you probably have a bad seal between the toilet horn (where the waste exits) and the drain line. Don’t procrastinate any longer. Small leaks trapped beneath the toilet will eventually rot floor surfaces, and even the underlying framing. Wait too long and repair costs rise, especially when you figure in replacing finished flooring and sometimes underlayments, subfloors or even the framing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, we’ll show you some tips for pulling the toilet (Photos 1 – 3) and then how to diagnose and fix the common causes of leaks. Finally, we’ll show you how to reset the toilet. After pulling the toilet and examining the evidence, you may get lucky and just have to replace the wax ring and remount the toilet. If that’s the case, you’ll have the stool back on-line in under an hour. You’ll find the products we suggest for making repairs at any home center or well-stocked hardware store.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may have one or more problems to solve, which may require more than one fix. So before you decide on a plan of action, check for:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A broken flange, usually on the outside of the slot that holds the toilet flange bolt (Photos 3 – 6).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A flange that’s too low. That includes any flange that’s more than 1/4 in. below the finished floor (Photos 7 and 8).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rot around the toilet flange (Photos 9 and 10).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple wax ring failure. If nothing appears to be wrong, resetting the toilet with a new wax ring might be the only thing you need to do (Photos 11 – 14).&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><summary type="html">Ultimate Guide to Fixing a Leaking Toilet</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">How to Rebuild a Water Softener</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/plumbing/2015/03/02/water-softener-repair.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="How to Rebuild a Water Softener" /><published>2015-03-02T19:57:28+05:30</published><updated>2015-03-02T19:57:28+05:30</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/plumbing/2015/03/02/water-softener-repair</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/plumbing/2015/03/02/water-softener-repair.html">&lt;h2 id=&quot;ultimate-guide-to-rebuild-a-your-water-softener&quot;&gt;Ultimate Guide to Rebuild a your water softener.&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A bum water softener control valve can cause the unit to leak or stop producing soft water. A leak automatically means a rebuild, but if you’ve run out of soft water, first check the power at the receptacle. If the receptacle works and your softener is more than five years old, chances are good that you’re due for a control valve rebuild. Water softener repair pros charge about $200 to do that. But you can do it yourself in about an hour and for less than $60. I’ll show you how to rebuild one of the most common valves (the Fleck 5600 series) and direct you to a Web site for rebuild instructions for other brands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’ll take some detective work to find the make and model of your control valve because they don’t have identifying labels. So take a photo of your valve and go to softenerparts.com. Click on “I.D. Your Control Valve” and match your photo to the valves there. If you have a Fleck control valve, buy a complete rebuild kit and follow the instructions here. If you have a different brand, locate the parts and rebuild instructions on the site’s menu.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Start the rebuild by relieving the internal water pressure. Turn the bypass valve to the “bypass” position and rotate the dial to the “backwash” position. Unplug the power cord. Then remove the back cover, the housing screws and the screw in the center of the main piston. Tilt the housing and lift it off. Remove the hold-down plate screws and the plate. Then grab the piston and pull it straight up (Photo 1). Next, remove the spacers and seals (Photo 2).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Remove the old brine valve and install the new one (Photo 3). Then install the new seals and spacers (Photo 4). Insert the new piston and install the hold-down plate. Reinstall the housing, turn on the water and check for leaks. Then turn the dial to put the unit into a manual regeneration and check again for leaks.&lt;/p&gt;
